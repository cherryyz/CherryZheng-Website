        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Cherry Zheng, and I am a first-year education major at UCR. I am an
independent, kind, innovative, self-motivated, and optimistic person who loves to discover new
things and come up with new ideas. I came to the U.S five years ago and since then, I have
learned to live more independently away from my parents and close family members. Growing
up as an English second language learner, I have learned a lot throughout this journey and have
always seen it as a challenge for myself, turning it into motivation. This new opportunity allowed
me to learn more about American culture and lifestyles. While learning a new language has been
challenging for me, it has been totally worth it. Since then, I have become very independent and
developed the characteristic of being unafraid of unexpected events, and I have truly learned how
to be adaptive. I have definitely grown a lot as a person and become stronger.<br><br>

        I love engaging in hands-on activities and DIY projects to express my creative side. In the future,
I aspire to pursue a career in the field of education, particularly working with people and in the
community. As a self-motivated individual, I am always eager to learn and grow both personally
and professionally. The field of education encourages me to work with a larger group of people,
providing a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction that comes from helping others succeed and
making a positive impact in society.<br><br>

       In addition to my desire to make a positive impact on society, pursuing a career in education
aligns perfectly with my personal characteristics and interests. My independent nature allows me
to take initiative and seek out new opportunities to enhance my teaching skills and knowledge. I
am not afraid to step out of my comfort zone and explore innovative teaching methods that can
engage and inspire students.<br><br>
      By combining my personal traits, passion for education, and dedication to making a difference, I
am confident that a career in education will allow me to fulfill my aspirations and positively
impact the lives of others.
